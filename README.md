# React + Vite Finance Tracker
Personal Finance Tracker

Description: A data visualization tool for tracking income and expenses, focused on performance optimization and data persistence.

    Tech Stack: React, Recharts, React Hook Form, LocalStorage, Context API.

    Key Features:

        Data Visualization: Integrated Recharts to render real-time Pie Charts representing financial distribution.

        Performance Optimization: Utilized useMemo hooks to cache heavy calculation logic (totals, filtering), preventing unnecessary re-renders during state updates.

        Efficient Forms: Used React Hook Form to manage input state, reducing the number of re-renders compared to controlled components.
